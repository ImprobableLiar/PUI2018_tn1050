# PUI2018 HW 7

## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis. 

Familiarizing ourselves with the US Census data, as well as working with Geopandas.

I used notebooks from Chris Prince's repo, as well as using Professor Federica Bianco's choroplethNYC package contents as reference on the plotting side of things. 

Special thank you to Lavender who has been the light of my life during Assignment 2 of this HW when I was confused reading the instructions.
